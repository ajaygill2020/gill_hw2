# homeworkTwo

Development workflows
=======================

Create new project
----------------------

You've already done this if you are reading this file. You ran:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:ajaygill2020/cookiecutter-datascience-simple
```

Put project under version control
---------------------------------

Let's get version control set up. You don't absolutely have to do this, but you should. For the local repository, do;

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

For the remote repository, make a github repository named homeworkTwo, then do;

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:ajaygill2020/homeworkTwo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Great. Using version control is good.
